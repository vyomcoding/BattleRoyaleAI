Algorithm for the prey AI:
	1) Play the game multiple times, each time trying out different angles. For that, we need a play again feature, and a code trying to show the best angle.
	2) Once you have covered all the angles, do the winning ones again, and see if they lose
	3) Repeat step 2 until 1 angle left.
	
 *we could have the AI simulate a game.

	For the predator AI we will stick with making the predators having to hunt the AIs by chasing at 0 degrees.



Fix the corners
  Make it so that the predator touching the prey decreases its health. As of now only the weapon can harm.

Done

-- Well done!

(Extra points!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
  Make another graph with the angle for the predator

i didn't do this bit. 

-- No worries.
